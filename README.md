# My starter template for a phoenix app.

This is a file that I can just point an agent to, to set up a brand new project just the way I want it.
This is better than code, because then you'd have to worry about packages going stale, and updating them.

And I've had tremendous success with latest project.

## Goals (same as starter.md)
- Use Phoenix with LiveView for the web app
- Use Postgres for persistence
- Use Oban for background jobs and scheduled work
- Deploy to Fly.io
- Use GitHub Actions for CI (and deploy on main if desired)
